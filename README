# Movie Recommendations

Converts movie ratings into a sparse matrix and uses the alternating least squares approach from "Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets" (doi: 10.1109/ICDM.2008.22)

Basically, this is a less efficient version of https://github.com/benfred/implicit.
However, as everything is written using Numpy, it might be easier to grasp.
